# Run 1770029725 - Gatekeeper

## Context
Targeting `tokmd-model` aggregation logic to ensure determinism regardless of input order (Tokei parallelism).

## Discovery
- `tokmd-model` handles `Languages` -> `Report` transformation.
- `tokei` parallel execution means `reports` order is unstable.
- `create_module_report` and `create_lang_report` sort outputs, but we need to prove that intermediate aggregation doesn't depend on order.
- Plan: Add a property-based/randomized test to shuffle `reports` and assert output identity.

## Execution
- Creating `crates/tokmd-model/tests/determinism.rs`.
- Using `simple_shuffle` (LCG) to avoid new dependencies.
