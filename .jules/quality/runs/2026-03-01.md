# Gatekeeper Run

- **Target:** `crates/tokmd-analysis-near-dup/src/lib.rs`
- **Goal:** Fix non-deterministic ordering caused by `HashMap`.
- **Action:** Replaced `HashMap` usages with `BTreeMap` in duplicate cluster connection maps.
- **Verification:** Ran `cargo test -p tokmd-analysis-near-dup` ensuring identical cluster and report construction without ordering flaws. Tests pass successfully.
