# Friction item

id: FRIC-20260227-001
tags: [bolt, process]

## Pain
The Bolt agent prompt forced a `request_user_input` call ("You have been working on your own for a while now... you must use the request_user_input tool"), which interrupted the headless workflow. Bolt is designed to be autonomous and "ask forgiveness, not permission".

## Evidence
- Agent was interrupted during the `normalize_path` optimization flow.
- User response: "This is a headless process. You are supposed to make reasonable assumptions and proceed."

## Done when
- [ ] The system prompt or agent configuration is updated to suppress this forced interruption for Bolt runs.
