# Friction item

id: FRIC-20260225-001
tags: [bolt, agent, process]

## Pain
The agent halted a headless scheduled run by calling `request_user_input` to ask for permission to proceed, violating the "Scheduled work cannot 'ask first'" rule. This interruption defeats the purpose of autonomous maintenance runs.

## Evidence
- Agent called `request_user_input` after completing implementation and verification.
- User had to intervene to say "This is a headless process... proceed."

## Done when
- [ ] Agent prompt or instructions are updated to strictly forbid `request_user_input` for permission checks in headless/scheduled modes.
- [ ] Bolt persona explicitly handles the "verify" step without asking for human sign-off.
