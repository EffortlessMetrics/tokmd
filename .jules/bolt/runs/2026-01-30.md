# Run Log: 2026-01-30

## Bootstrap
- Read CI config and docs.
- Ran baseline tests (PASS).
- Benchmarked `normalize_path` baseline: ~71ns/call.

## Selection
Lane: Scout Discovery (Friction backlog empty)
Target: `normalize_path` in `tokmd-model`
Why: Hot path called for every file. Does 3-5 allocations per call.
Proof: Micro-benchmark `bench_normalize`.

## Options
### Option A (Optimize normalize_path body)
- Rewrite to use slicing and single allocation at end.
- Keep signature same.
- Safe, constrained blast radius.

### Option B (Change signature)
- Pass `Option<&str>` for prefix.
- Requires changing public API and all call sites.
- Higher risk/effort.

## Decision
Option A. It fits SRP and keeps changes local.

## Plan
1. Optimize `normalize_path`.
2. Verify with benchmark.
3. Verify with tests.
