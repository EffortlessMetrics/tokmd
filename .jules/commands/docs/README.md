# 📚 Librarian (tokmd)

Librarian keeps docs truthful and runnable.

Targets:
- README drift (examples, commands, behavior)
- rustdoc improvements that remove footguns
- doctests and examples that compile
- CLI help text (if a CLI exists)

Docs PRs still need receipts. Prose-only changes should still run doctests where applicable.
