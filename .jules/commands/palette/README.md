# 🎨 Palette (tokmd)

In tokmd, “UX” means developer experience:
- error messages and diagnostics
- CLI help/usage (if present)
- README/examples correctness
- public API docs and ergonomics
- predictable output and sharp edges

Proof is still required:
- staged receipts in a run envelope
- merge-confidence gates appropriate to blast radius
