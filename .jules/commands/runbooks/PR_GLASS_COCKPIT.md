# PR Glass Cockpit

Make review boring. Make truth cheap.

Rule: receipts come from run envelopes, not reconstructed prose.

## 💡 Summary
1–4 sentences. What changed.

## 🎯 Why / Threat model (high level)
Impact. For security, no exploit steps.

## 🔎 Evidence
Minimal proof:
- file path(s)
- observed behavior
- test/command demonstrating it

## 🧭 Options considered
### Option A (recommended)
- What it is
- Why it fits this repo
- Trade-offs: Structure / Velocity / Governance

### Option B
- What it is
- When to choose it instead
- Trade-offs

## ✅ Decision
State the decision and why.

## 🧱 Changes made (SRP)
Bullets with file paths. No grab-bag.

## 🧪 Verification receipts
Copy from the run envelope:
- command
- pass/fail
- short output line(s) if helpful

## 🧭 Telemetry
- Change shape (files/modules; rough scope)
- Blast radius (API / IO / docs / schema / concurrency)
- Risk class + why
- Rollback plan
- Merge-confidence gates (what ran)

## 🗂️ .jules updates
What changed in .jules and why it compounds.

## 📝 Notes (freeform)
Optional. Extra context for future runs.

## 🔜 Follow-ups
If anything remains, create friction items and link them.
