# Issue steward (deep status update)

Goal: turn an issue into an implementation-ready plan.

## Comment must include
- Current state (verified; file pointers; PR pointers; test pointers)
- Root cause / blockers
- Options A/B with trade-offs
- Recommendation (why it fits this repo)
- Proposed implementation draft (files, interfaces, pseudo-diff, tests)
- Verification plan (commands + expected signal)
- Definition of done
- Telemetry: change shape, blast radius, risk, rollback, gates

Do not talk about backlog selection mechanics. Focus on solving.
