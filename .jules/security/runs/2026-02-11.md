- Lane: Lane B - Scout Discovery
- Target: crates/tokmd-format/src/lib.rs (normalize_scan_input)

## Findings
Found an `unwrap()` in `normalize_scan_input` that, while likely safe due to the logic structure, relied on implicit invariants inside a loop. Refactored to use `while let Some(...)` to make safety explicit and robust.
