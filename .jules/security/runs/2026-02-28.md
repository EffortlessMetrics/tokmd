# Security Run 2026-02-28

Lane: scout
Target: crates/tokmd/src/analysis_utils.rs

## Findings
- Found expect/unwrap calls in `map_preset` and its tests. Fixed them by returning `Result` instead.

## Options considered
### Option A
- Fix the `expect` in `map_preset` to return `Result`.
- Fix the tests by returning `Result<()>` from `test_map_preset_all_variants`.
- Use `?` in callers.

### Option B
- Ignore the panic since it shouldn't happen with valid Enums.

## Decision
Option A was chosen to reduce the presence of panics, expect, and unwraps in the codebase.
