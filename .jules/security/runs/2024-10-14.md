# Run Log: 2024-10-14

## Metadata
- **Run ID**: 20241014-001
- **Lane**: Scout Discovery
- **Target**: `crates/tokmd-format/src/lib.rs`

## Findings
Found an `unwrap()` in `normalize_scan_input` which is used across the codebase for path normalization. While likely safe due to the `starts_with` check, it's brittle and performs unnecessary allocations.

## Options Considered
### Option A (Selected)
Refactor `normalize_scan_input` to use string slicing and `while let Some(...)` pattern.
- Removes `unwrap()` panic risk.
- Reduces memory allocation (operates on slice until final `to_string()`).
- Covered by existing property tests.

### Option B
Leave as is.
- `starts_with` guarantees `unwrap` safety.
- Low risk, but violates "Sentinel" principle of burning down `unwrap`s.

## Decision
Proceed with Option A.

## Verification
Ran `cargo test -p tokmd-format properties` and full suite. All passed.
Also ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
