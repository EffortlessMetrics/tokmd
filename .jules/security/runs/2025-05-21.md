## Status
- [x] Lane Selected: Scout (focused sweep)
- [x] Target Selected: Determinism/IO Strictness
- [ ] PR Link: (placeholder)

## Findings
- Found `unwrap()` usage in `tokmd-cockpit/src/determinism.rs` tests.
- Found potentially unsafe file read error suppression in `hash_files_from_paths` and `hash_files_from_walk`.
- Decision: Option A (Strict Read Error Handling). Make `fs::read` errors explicit (except NotFound) to improve security posture and correctness.
