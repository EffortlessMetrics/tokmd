## Findings
Discovered that `tokmd export --redact paths` produced different hashes for equivalent paths (e.g. `foo` vs `foo/../foo`) because `redact_path` hashed the input string directly without full normalization.

Implemented `clean_path` in `tokmd-redact` to resolving `.` and `..` components before hashing.
Verified with reproduction script and unit tests.
