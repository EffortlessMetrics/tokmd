# Run Log: 2026-01-27

**Run ID:** run_20260127_130141
**Lane:** Scout
**Target:** crates/tokmd/tests/integration.rs

## Findings
- Scanned for `unsafe`: 0 results.
- Scanned for `unwrap`/`expect`:
  - Clean in production code (only 1 doc comment example).
  - High usage in `tests/integration.rs` (52 occurrences).
- Identified `tests/integration.rs` as a candidate for hardening.

## Decision
**Option A:** Refactor `crates/tokmd/tests/integration.rs` to use `Result` return types.
- **Why:** Removes panic-on-failure behavior for setup steps, improves error context, and burns down `unwrap` usage as per policy.
- **Trade-off:** Slightly more verbose test signatures.
