Run ID: `20250218-120000`

## Meta
- Lane: Scout
- Target: Gate `git` dependencies in `tokmd` and `tokmd-cockpit`
- PR: [TBD]

## Findings
`tokmd` failed to compile without default features (`--no-default-features`) because `tokmd-cockpit` (optional dependency) was missing in `baseline` command. Also, `hash_files_from_walk` in `tokmd-cockpit` was not gated by `git` feature as required.

## Options
### Option A
Gate `hash_files_from_walk` in `tokmd-cockpit` and gate `git`-dependent logic in `tokmd::commands` (baseline, cockpit, sensor).

### Option B
Make `tokmd-cockpit` a required dependency. (Bad for minimal builds).

## Decision
Option A. This aligns with reducing dependencies and enforcing feature boundaries.

## Verification
- `cargo check -p tokmd --no-default-features`: PASS
- `cargo check -p tokmd`: PASS
- `cargo check -p tokmd-cockpit --no-default-features`: PASS
- Full suite (`build`, `test`, `fmt`, `clippy`): PASS
