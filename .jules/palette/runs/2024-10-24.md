# Run Log: 2024-10-24

## Bootstrap
Read CI + docs:
- .github/workflows/
- CLAUDE.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- AGENTS.md

## Lane Selection
- [ ] Lane A: Friction Backlog
- [x] Lane B: Scout Discovery

## Target
`tokmd init --write-config` (Non-interactive config generation)

## Findings
`tokmd init` supported `.tokeignore` generation non-interactively, but not `tokmd.toml`.
This was a DX gap for scripted setups.

## Receipts
- Build passed.
- Clippy passed.
- New integration test `test_init_write_config` passed.

## Decision
Selected Option A: Add `--write-config` flag.
Implemented by refactoring config generation logic to `tokmd-config` and updating `init` command.
