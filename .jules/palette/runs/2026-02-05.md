## Context
Read: CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, Repo Layout.

## Lane Selection
Lane: Scout Discovery
Target: Add `json-pretty` format to `lang` and `module` commands.

## Scout Findings
- `tokmd` CLI supports `json` (compact) output for `lang` and `module` commands.
- Users (and LLMs) often benefit from pretty-printed JSON for readability.
- Currently, users must pipe to `jq` or similar tools.
- `tokmd` aims to be "chat-friendly".

## Decisions
Options:
### Option A: Add `json-pretty` to `TableFormat`
- **What**: Add `JsonPretty` variant to `TableFormat` enum in `tokmd-types` and implement it in `tokmd-format`.
- **Why**: Improves DX by allowing readable JSON output directly from the CLI without external tools.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a variant to a "semi-stable" enum. However, it's a minor version change and `TableFormat` derives `ValueEnum` so it's a non-breaking CLI addition.

### Option B: Do nothing (rely on `jq`)
- **What**: Keep existing behavior.
- **Why**: Keep API surface small.
- **Trade-offs**: Worse DX for users without `jq` or who want quick readable output.

Selected: Option A
