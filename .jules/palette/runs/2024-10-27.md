# Run Log: 2024-10-27

## Initialization
- Read: CI configs, README, CONTRIBUTING, AGENTS.md (missing).
- Baseline gates: build, test (passed/assumed).

## Lane Selection
- Selected: **Scout** (Friction backlog was empty/missing).
- Target: **Error on non-existent input paths**.
- Findings: `tokmd non_existent_path` returns exit code 0 and an empty table. This is confusing.

## Options Considered
### Option A: Strict Error (Recommended)
- Validate all provided input paths before scanning.
- If *any* path is missing, return an error immediately.
- Why: Fail fast. Prevents typos from producing misleading valid-looking empty results. Better for scripts.
- Trade-off: Slightly stricter than `ls` (which lists what it can and warns about others), but `tokmd` aggregates results, so partial success is harder to notice.

### Option B: Warn and Proceed
- Warn for missing paths.
- Proceed with valid paths.
- Error only if *all* paths are missing.
- Why: More lenient.
- Trade-off: Users might miss the warning in stderr and assume the output covers everything they asked for.

## Decision
**Option A**. In a data/inventory tool, correctness is paramount. Silently (or quietly) dropping requested inputs undermines trust in the "receipt".

## Implementation Plan
1.  Reproduce with a test case in `crates/tokmd/tests/integration.rs` or new file.
2.  Modify `crates/tokmd-scan/src/lib.rs` to validate paths.
3.  Update tests.
4.  Verify.
