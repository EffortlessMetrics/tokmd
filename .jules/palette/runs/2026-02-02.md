Target: Fix `tokmd init` CLI ergonomics (positional arg support)

## Findings
- `tokmd init` requires `--dir`, which is non-standard and causes friction.
- `tokmd diff` help text is slightly misleading but functional.
- Missing `init` positional arg is a "sharp edge" for new users.

## Receipts
- Checked `tokmd init` help text.
- Verified `tokmd init myproject` fails.
