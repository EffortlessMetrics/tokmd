## Task
Fix unused import warning in `crates/tokmd/tests/run_diff.rs` when `git` feature is disabled.

## Actions
1. Discovered warning via `cargo check --test run_diff --no-default-features`.
2. Gated `use std::process::Command as ProcessCommand;` with `#[cfg(feature = "git")]`.
3. Verified with both minimal and default feature sets.

## Outcome
Tests pass without warnings in both configurations.
