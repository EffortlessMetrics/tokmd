# Compat Run: 2026-03-01

- **Lane:** Scout Discovery
- **Target:** `tokmd-analysis-entropy` tests
- **Issue:** The test `path_normalization::given_backslash_paths_then_normalized_in_output` failed on Unix systems because `File::open` received backslashes which were not normalized before opening.
- **Fix:** Used the replaced string `rel_str` instead of `rel` to build the full path.
- **Gates:**
  - `cargo test --workspace --no-default-features --exclude tokmd-python --exclude tokmd-node`
  - `cargo test --workspace --all-features --exclude tokmd-python --exclude tokmd-node`
