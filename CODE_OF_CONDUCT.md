# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in **tokmd** a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, constructive, and professional.
- Showing empathy toward other people.
- Giving and gracefully accepting feedback.
- Focusing on what’s best for the community and the project.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Disagreeing about ideas, not people.
- Keeping discussions grounded in evidence and reproducible behavior when possible (especially for bugs and regressions).

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., a physical or email address) without explicit permission.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Sustained disruption of discussions (e.g., repeated bad-faith arguing, derailing, or “winning” over collaborating).
- Unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would consider inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Project spaces include (but are not limited to): GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, code review threads, release notes, and community channels used for tokmd development.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it to the maintainers:

- **Primary contact:** https://effortlesssteven.com/about/

Reports may be made privately. We will review and investigate reports promptly and fairly.

When reporting, helpful details include:

- What happened (with links/screenshots if available)
- When it happened
- Where it happened
- Who was involved
- Any relevant context (e.g., prior interaction)

We will respect the privacy and security of the reporter as much as possible, consistent with the need to investigate and address the issue.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1) Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from maintainers providing clarity about the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public note may be used if it helps the community understand the boundary without naming/shaming.

### 2) Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions that is clearly disruptive.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning with a clear statement that continued behavior will result in further action. Conditions for continued participation may be imposed (e.g., cooling-off period, communication constraints).

### 3) Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained disruptive behavior or repeated violations.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from participation in project spaces for a specified period of time. Upon return, participation may be subject to additional conditions.

### 4) Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation, harassment, or hostility, or any behavior that seriously threatens the safety of community members.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from participation in project spaces.
